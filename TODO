--- When ? idk ---
- Build matrix ADT [X]

--- 2023-07-23 ---
- Test all the componets [X]

----- MAIN OBJECTS -----
- Do the math for complex numbers back propagation [ ]
- Build an mat of complex parameters [ ]
- And make the Var object be able to multiply with compatible data types [ ]
- Code the Computational Graph lib to accelerate the feedforward operations in a model [ ]

--- 2024-01-05 ---
- Refactor the mat component [X]
- Build an struct shape and contained in the mat object [X]
- Create a better version of the print of the matrix [X]
- Build utilites to build matrices files [ ]
- Try to get that 2.9s in mat mul 1000x1000 [ ]
- Build simple mat prints [ ]

----- IMPORTANT -----
- Build the optimizer dependency and add the SGD, GD optimizer [ ]
- Build the Model object, ---> batch size <--- super important [ ]
- Separate backprop algorithm from the classes layers and weights [ ]
- Change the name of the cost functions to loss functions and add more loss functions [ ]

--- 2024-01-15 ---
- Separate in folders the different modules and build the respect libs [X]
- Build an structure of Rawmat [ ], idk rick
- Write proper excepts for the library [ ]

--- 2024-01-21 ---
- Prepare Build a custum allocator for the matrices, read this doc https://indiegamedev.net/2022/03/27/custom-c20-memory-allocators-for-stl-containers/
  not sure yet if it is necessary for the project [ ]
